Project Title: Using Machine Learning Models to Predict Suicide Risk among High School Students in California
Author: Anh L Tran

## Description:
This is my graduate-course project for my Computational Data Analysis/Machine Learning class. In this project, I analyzed the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm and built 3 machine learning classification models: binary logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, and decision tree to predict low and high suicide risk based on a variety of health-risk behaviors among high school students in California.

## Files:
 - data: the data includes only the YRBS data limited to the state of California in 2015 and 2017. For the full YRBS data, you can access it at https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/data.htm
 - code: there are 5 R codes that I wrote to prepare, analyze, and build the machine learning models for this project
 - output: this includes an excel file to where I put my results of the analyses and the performances of the models. 
 - my final paper for this project
